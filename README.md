This is an application made using handlebars, MySQL, and jQuery.  It allows a user to enter the name of a hamburger they would like to eat.  After entering the name of the burger, the entry is stored in the MySQL database and displayed on the page in the left hand column.  Its placement, and its red background, indicate that the burger has been ordered but not yet eaten.  The user can change this by clicking the devour button of a specific burger, which changes one of its properties in the database and subsequently places the entry from the left hand column to the right hand column while also changing the background color from red to purple.  Lastly, this process can be undone by clicking the "undevour" button, which switches the entry back from the right hand column to the left hand column and restores its background color to red.
